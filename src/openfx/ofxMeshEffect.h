/** @brief

 Sometimes an effect can pass through an input uprocessed, for example a
 displace effect with a displace amplitude of 0. This action can be called by a
 host before it attempts to cook an effect to determine if it can simply
 copy input directly to output without having to call the render action
 on the effect.

 If the effect does not need to process any geometry, it should set the
 value of the \ref kOfxPropName to the input that the host should us as the
 output instead, and the \ref kOfxPropTime property on ``outArgs`` to be
 the time at which the frame should be fetched from a clip.

 The default action is to call the render action on the effect.


 @param  handle handle to the instance, cast to an \ref OfxMeshEffectHandle
 @param  inArgs has the following properties
     - \ref kOfxPropTime the time at which to test for identity

 @param  outArgs has the following properties which the plugin can set
     - \ref kOfxPropName
     this to the name of the input that should be used if the effect is
     an identity transform, defaults to the empty string
     - \ref kOfxPropTime
     the time to use from the indicated source input as an identity
     mesh (allowing time slips to happen), defaults to the value in
     \ref kOfxPropTime in inArgs



 @returns
     -  \ref kOfxStatOK, the action was trapped and the effect should not have its
     render action called, the values in outArgs
     indicate what frame from which input to use instead
     -  \ref kOfxStatReplyDefault, the action was not trapped and the host should
     call the cook action
     -  \ref kOfxStatErrMemory, in which case the action may be called again after
     a memory purge
     -  \ref kOfxStatFailed, something wrong, but no error code appropriate,
     plugin to post message
     -  \ref kOfxStatErrFatal

 This action is where an effect gets to compute geometry and turn its input
 mesh and parameter set into an output mesh. This is possibly quite
 complicated and covered in the \ref CookingEffects "Cooking Mesh Effects" chapter.

 \ref kOfxStatReplyDefault.

/** @brief

 This action is unique to OFX Mesh Effect plug-ins. Because a plugin is
 able to exhibit different behaviour depending on the context of use,
 each separate context will need to be described individually. It is
 within this action that mesh effects describe which parameters and
 input geometry it requires.

 This action will be called multiple times, one for each of the contexts
 the plugin says it is capable of implementing. If a host does not
 support a certain context, then it need not call
 \ref kOfxMeshEffectActionDescribeInContext for that context.

 This action *must* be trapped, it is not optional.

 @param  handle handle to the context descriptor, cast to an \ref OfxMeshEffectHandle
 this may or may not be the same as passed to \ref kOfxActionDescribe

 @param  inArgs has the following property:
     - \ref kOfxMeshEffectPropContext the context being described

 @param  outArgs is redundant and is set to NULL

\pre

     - \ref kOfxActionCreateInstance has not been called

     -  \ref kOfxStatErrMissingHostFeature, in which the context will be ignored
     by the host, the plugin may post a message
